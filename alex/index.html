<h1>ALEXANDER AND I</h1>
	<h2>a fantasy novel by jacob probst</h2>
	<h2>-EXPLICIT CONTENT WARNING-</h2>

<div class="story">
	  <h2>Preface</h2>
	  <p>  Alexander Emery is an associate of mine. He is a mediocre quarterback, and starts for the Skyline Eagles, <br>
		  wearing #12 because that's the number of felonies he has commited in the state of Oregon.<br>
		  After commiting these felonies and ruining his D1 chances in Oregon, Alex decided to move to Utah, hoping for a fresh start, where he met me.<br>
		  Me and Alex originally met in June 2021, during a football practice. </p>
	<h1><b> This is our Story</b> </h1>
	<h2><b> Chapter One </b></h2>
	  
	  <p>  <b> I didn't know who he was, and frankly I didn't care. I remember blocking one of his passes in a practice,
		  he got in trouble and Coach Robotham wove a tapestry of curses so exquisite and rare that it should be in a museum.
		  Unfortunately, I had to quit the team that year due to health concerns, and I honestly forgot all about that scrawny, skinny, annoying little kid.
		  Little did I know, that kid would be my future second/third best friend.<br>
		  Fast forward. Now it was the first day of school and I was roughly 3 minutes late to my last period, as I always am. <br>
		  Mr. Kapptie greeted me with the smile of an angel, his warm beckoning eyes and perfectly trimmed facial hair takimg me agast, and I tried not to blush. 
		  I took a seat in the front row, since I have subpar vision and wished to see the screen. 
		  I looked to my left and saw a girl whose name I did not know, and don't intend to learn 
		  When a voice to my right said "Holy Shit, you're tall as a Motherfucker on a thursday afternoon". <br>
		  I looked to my right and found the owner of the voice, a short yet fat kid with a subpar middle part, a harsh stare and flipped him off, 
		  trying to indicate that I didn't give the slightest fuck about this rash comment, 
		  but the bastard couldn't be avoided.<br>
		  "Hey, I'm talking to you, Yeah you, the bitch ass boi" said the kid, a lebanese version of the kid from polar express, with a taunting tone in his voice. <br>
		  "Fuck off cunt"<br>
		  "Shut up you may be 6'7" but u only weigh 200 bitch" said he.<br>
		  "Yeah about half of what your mom weighs" I replied.<br>
		  "My Moms dead"<br>
		  "Who?"<br>
"My mom"<br>
"No who cares"<br>
		  Tears of pain and sorrow tried to ecsape my young foe's eyes, as I laughed diabolically. <br>
		  "Take that shit back right now"<br>
		  "Or what"<br>
		  "Or I'll fuck u up, that's what"<br>
		  "Oh yeah?"<br>
		  "Yeah"<br>
		  "I'd like to see you try"<br>
		  "Meet me in the gym at 2:30 or you a chicken ass bitch"<br>
			  <i> (The Phrase Chicken ass bitch has always seemed a bit strange to me. 
				  What exactly is a chicken ass bitch? Webster's Mediterranian Dictionary defines it as, 
		  		"A person who backs down from a challenge,
		   		and possesses qualities similar to that of a bitch". 
				  But I think its weird. If a chicken is a chicken, and an ass is a donkey, and a bitch is a dog, 
				then what sort of derranged animal is a chicken ass bitch?)</i> <br>
			
		  "You better be there you cock sucker" Said I as the final bell rang.<br>
		  As I sat in the bathroom stall at around 2:20, I pondered the events of the day, and tried to take my mind off of the troubles to come.
I thought back on the kid, and what he had been like.
The kid, who had the body of Ariana Grande, had smiled. It wasn't your everyday smile either.
 The smile wasn't that of someone who was angry, but that of a horny guy. 
I tried to shake the  feeling that something was different than other fights I had been in before.
		As I unloaded a massive dump half the size of Kansas, mind drifted and I found myself daydreaming of Mr. Kapptie's excellent physique, 
and I'm ashamed to say I fantasized about us.
		Suddenly, an adjacent stall let out the sound of a demon straight from hell, and a smell that even Hellen Keller could smell filled the room.
		I jerked up from my seat, checking my phone. <br>
			"Aw shit" I said, seeing the time was 2:28.<br>
		Racing down the halls as fast as I could, I didn't even notice that I forgot to wipe, or the diarrhea dripping down to my leg.
		I arrived at the gym at exactly 2:30 and I all I could see was big booty, hella thick, juicy ass volleyball girls stretching their quads. 
		I waited for five minutes, staring with all focus at the animals, or as they call themselves, women, for the kid to arrive, and decided I should leave. 
Just before the door shut behind me, I heard a voice.<br>
		It was his voice. </b>
		  <p>
		  <h2><b> Chapter 2 </b> </h2>
		  <p><b> 
"Come here bitch" said the voice that reminded me of Jackie Chan.
Turning around, I saw the skinny kid with pubic hair on his chin.
"Ready to get Fucked?" he said, with a glint in his eye.
I saw the look in his eye, and for a moment, only a moment, thought I realized something.
It couldn't possibly be true, so I discarded it withought a second thought, and returned my focus to the task at hand.<br>
 "I'm not gay, you gay ass bitch."<br>
"Oh"<br>
"Are we doing this or not?"<br>
"Fucking?"<br>
"We fighting right now boy."<br>
Then something hapened that I couldn't explain. The kid, who I thought had been trying to fight me, simply ran away. 
At the time I thought he was running from a fight, but now I know that's not why he ran that day.<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
I woke up at 7:45. Normally I would already be 15 minutes late to class, but today was Friday, and Fridays started at 8:30, an hour later than normal. 
I started my day the way I always do, with a quick visit to my sock, a workout, and then breakfast. <br>
"Hey dad: I said<br>

"Oh yeah, you left mom 18 years ago, I forgot."<br>
I sat down to eat breakfast. I had made a protein smoothie with eggs and coicane for breakfast.
as I ate my food the way I do most mornings, naked, I made a mental list of my schedule for the day. <br>
8:15- Leave for school.<br>
8:25- Arrive and walk to zoology.<br>
8:30/ 930- Zoology.<br>
9:35/ 10:35- English. <br>
10:40/ 10:41- Have sex with that one horse girl Nadia in the parking lot.<br>
10:42/ 11:40- History.<br>
11:41/ 11:42- Bang the Mormon chick Louisa in the East bathroom. <br>
11:43/ 12:15- Lunch.<br>
12:20/ 2:10- Mr. Kappties class. <br>
I put a heart by the last Item on the list, because it was my favorite thing I would do that day.
As the day progressed, I thought nothing of the day before, or the events that had occured. 
Sitting in Mr. Kappties class, I was bored of watching porn on the school computer, so I checked my DM's.<br>
'Six messages from Nadia and four from Louisa' I thought to myself. <br>
'fuck'<br> 
I clicked on the latter, and found tit pics. I tried not to cringe thinking I had once found her face attractive. 
Then, checking the messages from Nadia, I couldn't hold back laughter when I saw a picture of her positive pregnancy test. <br>
"I'll buy u a pill" I messaged.<br>
"Thanks. You're a real gentleman. Also when can we fuck again, I already miss feeling you inside of me"<br>
"Learn your place bitch. You're lucky I lowered my standards for you."<br>
"Okay"<br>
Then, turning off my phone, I heard some tapping. At first I didn't recognize it, but after about 3 minutes, I realized it was Morse Code. <br>
"I-M H-O-R-N-Y L-E-T-S F-U-C-K"<br>

<h2> <b> Chapter 3 </b> </h2>
<p><b> 
 It had been a foggy September night. 
As we walked down the cobblestone streets of Paris, Mr. Kapptie and I could not help but make fleeting eye contact. By the time we reached the ice cream parlor,
it had become clear that there was an unspoken bond between us. We shared a double scoop rocky road and talked about lost loves, and our sexual experiences, bad or good.
As we exited the ice cream store, we both saw a deserted alley. Looking quickly at each other, we both raced toward it. Our lips had touched, a feeling that aroused
me more than Brooke Nadia, Lauren, Big bird, Aaron hernandes, Adolf hitler, Elmo, or Louisa ever had. As he unbuckled my pants, he hesitated. <br>
"How do I know you're not like the others?" said he, with a tear in his eye. <br>
"You don't, but this chance, this moment, is all we have, it's what we cling to, it's what makes us real."<br>
We both cried, a single tear of his landing on my penis as he looked up at me, deepthroating me with increased rage. We switched tactics, and I entered him,
slowly at first, but with increased passion and rage. We howled and screamed until dawn, at which point his balls were so drained that his sack had shrieveled up into his foreskin.
As the sun rose, so had we, with now an unincreasing personal connection. 
As we woke, we wondered which way our feelings would take us. At this point, my alarm woke me up and i faced the oncoming day with vigor and pride.
While I ate my typical breakfast of orange peels, mother earth was begining to touch the browning leaves of early fall. Jack frost seemed to have 
more fun than ever, placing his gentle finger on the windshields of all.
Walking into first period, I was interrupted by my teacher, mr. odil lloyd, who now that I think of it, I havent seen or heard of since high school.
and yet vaguely I remember him being on the news. Anyways, he interruted me and handed a note, telling me a young nigerian gentleman by the name of Alexander
had given it to him. I took the note, trying to not make a big deal out of the fact that there was a penis  with hearts for balls
drawn on the front of the letter. <br> (I've made a pact with the Chinese Government to never reveal the specifics of what the letter contained that day, 
but it is more than enough to say that there were some haunting images enclosed in that envelope) <br>
Anyways, as I walked down the halls to second period, my mind had drifted to the dream i had had the night before. I enlarged myself thinking about it, and texted a girl
named Tienna. She arrived in the middle of my third period, walking into my math class completely neud, with a care-bear tatoo on her left breast. She shouted out to me.<br>
"Jacob, Im horny, satisfy me or pay the consequenses"<br>
"Tienna, Im tired of you. Your once perfect breasts no longer arouse me, your nipples, while pierced perfectly, no longer pierce my already broken heart. <br>
your plump rump can no longer quench my unceasing thirst for Kapptie. Were done."<br>
"Jacob, please, I don't want to do this."<br>
"Im sorry"<br>
"No Jacob, I'm sorry."<br>
As she said this, her hair started to lift. Her eyes glowed red and she started to levitate. She started to murmur in africaan tones, her skin glowing a tone of pink that I cannot describe.
She glided towards, me and when her lips made contact with mine, I was teleported to her lair. <br>
		  
		  <!-- I started to get suspicious when he told me He was not allowed within 500 Feet of a School Zone. 
		  I Googled his name, and found out about his past. When I confronted him about it, he admitted to it, and asked if we could still be friends. 
		  I said yes, but as time continued, I found it harder and harder to feel comfortable around him. <br>
		  Eventually I was able too look past his past and see him for the guy he is, and ever since we have been close friends. <br>
		  The Supreme Court is currently reviewing his 6th case, and I told Alex I would be willing to testify in his behalf. <br>
		  In conclusion, Alexander Emery is my Friend, and although he has a shady past, the lesson I have learned since meeting him is to not judge a book by it's past,
		  or however the saying goes. I wish nothing but the best for Alex, and hope the Judges of the Supreme Court to find it in their hearts to help him. -->
