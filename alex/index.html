	<h1>ALEXANDER AND I</h1>
	<h2>a fantasy novel by jacob probst</h2>
	<h2>-EXPLICIT CONTENT WARNING-</h2>

<div class="story">
	  <h2>Preface</h2>
	  <p>  Alexander Emery is an associate of mine. He is a mediocre quarterback, and starts for the Skyline Eagles, <br>
		  wearing #12 because that's the number of felonies he has commited in the state of Oregon.<br>
		  After commiting these felonies and ruining his D1 chances in Oregon, Alex decided to move to Utah, hoping for a fresh start, where he met me.<br>
		  Me and Alex originally met in June 2021, during a football practice. </p>
	<h1><b> This is our Story</b> </h1>
	<h2><b> Chapter One </b></h2>
	  
	  <p>  <b> I didn't know who he was, and frankly I didn't care. I remember blocking one of his passes in a practice,
		  he got in trouble and Coach Robotham wove a tapestry of curses so exquisite and rare that it should be in a museum.
		  Unfortunately, I had to quit the team that year due to health concerns, and I honestly forgot all about that scrawny, skinny, annoying little kid.
		  Little did I know, that kid would be my future second/third best friend.<br>
		  Fast forward. Now it was the first day of school and I was roughly 3 minutes late to my last period, as I always am. <br>
		  Mr. Kapptie greeted me with the smile of an angel, his warm beckoning eyes and perfectly trimmed facial hair takimg me agast, and I tried not to blush. 
		  I took a seat in the front row, since I have subpar vision and wished to see the screen. 
		  I looked to my left and saw a girl whose name I did not know, and don't intend to learn 
		  When a voice to my right said "Holy Shit, you're tall as a Motherfucker on a thursday afternoon". <br>
		  I looked to my right and found the owner of the voice, a short yet fat kid with a subpar middle part, a harsh stare and flipped him off, 
		  trying to indicate that I didn't give the slightest fuck about this rash comment, 
		  but the bastard couldn't be avoided.<br>
		  "Hey, I'm talking to you, Yeah you, the bitch ass boi" said the kid, a lebanese version of the kid from polar express, with a taunting tone in his voice. <br>
		  "Fuck off cunt"<br>
		  "Shut up you may be 6'7" but u only weigh 200 bitch" said he.<br>
		  "Yeah about half of what your mom weighs" I replied.<br>
		  "My Moms dead"<br>
		  "Sucks to suck you stupid fuck"<br>
		  Tears of pain and sorrow tried to ecsape my young foe's eyes. <br>
		  "Take that shit back right now"<br>
		  "Or what"<br>
		  "Or I'll kick your ass, that's what"<br>
		  "Oh yeah?"<br>
		  "Yeah"<br>
		  "I'd like to see you try"<br>
		  "Meet me in the gym at 2:30 or you a chicken ass bitch"<br>
			  <i> (The Phrase Chicken ass bitch has always seemed a bit strange to me. 
				  What exactly is a chicken ass bitch? Webster's Mediterranian Dictionary defines it as, 
		  		"A person who backs down from a challenge,
		   		and possesses qualities similar to that of a bitch". 
				  But I think its weird. If a chicken is a chicken, and an ass is a donkey, and a bitch is a dog, 
				then what sort of derranged animal is a chicken ass bitch?)</i> <br>
			
		  "You better be there you cock sucker" Said I as the final bell rang.<br>
		  As I sat in the bathroom stall at around 2:20, I pondered the events of the day, and tried to take my mind off of the troubles to come.
		My mind drifted and I found myself daydreaming of Mr. Kapptie's excellent physique, and I'm ashamed to say I fantasized about us.
		Suddenly, an adjacent stall let out the sound of a demon straight from hell, and a smell that even Hellen Keller could smell filled the room.
		I jerked up from my seat, checking my phone. <br>
			"Aw shit" I said, seeing the time was 2:28.<br>
		Racing down the halls as fast as I could, I didn't even notice that I forgot to wipe.
		I arrived at the gym at exactly 2:30 and I all I could see was big booty, hella thick, juicy ass volleyball girls stretching their quads. 
		I waited for five minutes for the kid to arrive, and decided I should leave. Just before the door shut behind me, I heard a voice.
		It was his voice. </b>
		  <p>

		  <!-- I started to get suspicious when he told me He was not allowed within 500 Feet of a School Zone. 
		  I Googled his name, and found out about his past. When I confronted him about it, he admitted to it, and asked if we could still be friends. 
		  I said yes, but as time continued, I found it harder and harder to feel comfortable around him. <br>
		  Eventually I was able too look past his past and see him for the guy he is, and ever since we have been close friends. <br>
		  The Supreme Court is currently reviewing his 6th case, and I told Alex I would be willing to testify in his behalf. <br>
		  In conclusion, Alexander Emery is my Friend, and although he has a shady past, the lesson I have learned since meeting him is to not judge a book by it's past,
		  or however the saying goes. I wish nothing but the best for Alex, and hope the Judges of the Supreme Court to find it in their hearts to help him. -->
