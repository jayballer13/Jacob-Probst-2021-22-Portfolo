BEE MOVIE SCRIPT
 
ACCORDING TO ALL KNOWN LAWS OF AVIATION,
THERE IS NO WAY A BEE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FLY.<BR>
ITS WINGS ARE TOO SMALL TO GET ITS FAT LITTLE BODY OFF THE GROUND.<BR>
THE BEE, OF COURSE, FLIES ANYWAY
BECAUSE BEES DON'T CARE WHAT HUMANS THINK IS IMPOSSIBLE.<BR>
YELLOW, BLACK.<BR> YELLOW, BLACK.<BR>
YELLOW, BLACK.<BR> YELLOW, BLACK.<BR>
OOH, BLACK AND YELLOW!<BR>
LET'S SHAKE IT UP A LITTLE.<BR>

- A LITTLE.<BR> SPECIAL DAY, GRADUATION.<BR>
NEVER THOUGHT I'D MAKE IT.<BR>
THREE DAYS GRADE SCHOOL, THREE DAYS HIGH SCHOOL.<BR>
THOSE WERE AWKWARD.<BR>
THREE DAYS COLLEGE.<BR> I'M GLAD I TOOK A DAY AND HITCHHIKED AROUND THE HIVE.<BR>
YOU DID COME BACK DIFFERENT.<BR>
- HI, BARRY.<BR>
- ARTIE, GROWING A MUSTACHE?<BR> LOOKS GOOD.<BR>
- HEAR ABOUT FRANKIE?<BR>
- YEAH.<BR>

- NO, I'M NOT GOING.<BR>
EVERYBODY KNOWS, STING SOMEONE, YOU DIE.<BR>
DON'T WASTE IT ON A SQUIRREL.<BR>
SUCH A HOTHEAD.<BR>
I GUESS HE COULD HAVE JUST GOTTEN OUT OF THE WAY.<BR>
I LOVE THIS INCORPORATING AN AMUSEMENT PARK INTO OUR DAY.<BR>
THAT'S WHY WE DON'T NEED VACATIONS.<BR>
BOY, QUITE A BIT OF POMP.<BR>.<BR>.<BR> UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.<BR>
- WELL, ADAM, TODAY WE ARE MEN.<BR>
- WE ARE!<BR>

- AMEN!<BR>
HALLELUJAH!<BR>
STUDENTS, FACULTY, DISTINGUISHED BEES, PLEASE WELCOME DEAN BUZZWELL.<BR>

THAT CONCLUDES OUR CEREMONIES.<BR> AND BEGINS YOUR CAREER AT HONEX INDUSTRIES!<BR>
WILL WE PICK OURJOB TODAY?<BR>
I HEARD IT'S JUST ORIENTATION.<BR>
HEADS UP!<BR> HERE WE GO.<BR>
KEEP YOUR HANDS AND ANTENNAS
INSIDE THE TRAM AT ALL TIMES.<BR>
- WONDER WHAT IT'LL BE LIKE?<BR>
- A LITTLE SCARY.<BR>
WELCOME TO HONEX,
A DIVISION OF HONESCO
AND A PART OF THE HEXAGON GROUP.<BR>
THIS IS IT!<BR>
WOW.<BR>
WOW.<BR>
WE KNOW THAT YOU, AS A BEE,
HAVE WORKED YOUR WHOLE LIFE
TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU
CAN WORK FOR YOUR WHOLE LIFE.<BR>
HONEY BEGINS WHEN OUR VALIANT POLLEN
JOCKS BRING THE NECTAR TO THE HIVE.<BR>
OUR TOP-SECRET FORMULA
IS AUTOMATICALLY COLOR-CORRECTED,
SCENT-ADJUSTED AND BUBBLE-CONTOURED
INTO THIS SOOTHING SWEET SYRUP
WITH ITS DISTINCTIVE
GOLDEN GLOW YOU KNOW AS.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>
HONEY!<BR>
- THAT GIRL WAS HOT.<BR>
- SHE'S MY COUSIN!<BR>
- SHE IS?<BR>
- YES, WE'RE ALL COUSINS.<BR>
- RIGHT.<BR> YOU'RE RIGHT.<BR>
- AT HONEX, WE CONSTANTLY STRIVE
TO IMPROVE EVERY ASPECT
OF BEE EXISTENCE.<BR>
THESE BEES ARE STRESS-TESTING
A NEW HELMET TECHNOLOGY.<BR>
- WHAT DO YOU THINK HE MAKES?<BR>
- NOT ENOUGH.<BR>
HERE WE HAVE OUR LATEST ADVANCEMENT,
THE KRELMAN.<BR>
- WHAT DOES THAT DO?<BR>
- OATCHES THAT LITTLE STRAND OF HONEY
THAT HANGS AFTER YOU POUR IT.<BR>
SAVES US MILLIONS.<BR>
OAN ANYONE WORK ON THE KRELMAN?<BR>
OF COURSE.<BR> MOST BEE JOBS ARE SMALL ONES.<BR> BUT BEES KNOW
THAT EVERY SMALL JOB, IF IT'S DONE WELL, MEANS A LOT.<BR>
BUT CHOOSE CAREFULLY
BECAUSE YOU'LL STAY IN THE JOB YOU PICK FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.<BR>
THE SAME JOB THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?<BR>
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.<BR>
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?<BR>
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT BEES, AS A SPECIES, HAVEN'T HAD ONE DAY OFF
IN 27 MILLION YEARS.<BR>
SO YOU'LL JUST WORK US TO DEATH?<BR>
WE'LL SURE TRY.<BR>
WOW!<BR> THAT BLEW MY MIND!<BR>
"WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?<BR>"
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?<BR>
ONE JOB FOREVER?<BR>
THAT'S AN INSANE CHOICE TO HAVE TO MAKE.<BR>
I'M RELIEVED.<BR> NOW WE ONLY HAVE TO MAKE ONE DECISION IN LIFE.<BR>
BUT, ADAM, HOW COULD THEY NEVER HAVE TOLD US THAT?<BR>
WHY WOULD YOU QUESTION ANYTHING?<BR>
WE'RE BEES.<BR>
WE'RE THE MOST PERFECTLY FUNCTIONING SOCIETY ON EARTH.<BR>
YOU EVER THINK MAYBE THINGS WORK A LITTLE TOO WELL HERE?<BR>
LIKE WHAT?<BR> GIVE ME ONE EXAMPLE.<BR>
I DON'T KNOW.<BR> BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.<BR>
PLEASE CLEAR THE GATE.<BR> ROYAL NECTAR FORCE ON APPROACH.<BR>
WAIT A SECOND.<BR> OHECK IT OUT.<BR>
- HEY, THOSE ARE POLLEN JOCKS!<BR>
- WOW.<BR>
I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM THIS CLOSE.<BR>
THEY KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE OUTSIDE THE HIVE.<BR>
YEAH, BUT SOME DON'T COME BACK.<BR>
- HEY, JOCKS!<BR>
- HI, JOCKS!<BR>
YOU GUYS DID GREAT!<BR>
YOU'RE MONSTERS!<BR>
YOU'RE SKY FREAKS!<BR> I LOVE IT!<BR> I LOVE IT!<BR>
- I WONDER WHERE THEY WERE.<BR>
- I DON'T KNOW.<BR>
THEIR DAY'S NOT PLANNED.<BR>
OUTSIDE THE HIVE, FLYING WHO KNOWS WHERE, DOING WHO KNOWS WHAT.<BR>
YOU CAN'TJUST DECIDE TO BE A POLLEN JOCK.<BR> YOU HAVE TO BE BRED FOR THAT.<BR>
RIGHT.<BR>
LOOK.<BR> THAT'S MORE POLLEN THAN YOU AND I WILL SEE IN A LIFETIME.<BR>
IT'S JUST A STATUS SYMBOL.<BR> BEES MAKE TOO MUCH OF IT.<BR>
PERHAPS.<BR> UNLESS YOU'RE WEARING IT
AND THE LADIES SEE YOU WEARING IT.<BR>
THOSE LADIES?<BR>
AREN'T THEY OUR COUSINS TOO?<BR>
DISTANT.<BR> DISTANT.<BR>
LOOK AT THESE TWO.<BR>
- OOUPLE OF HIVE HARRYS.<BR>
- LET'S HAVE FUN WITH THEM.<BR>
IT MUST BE DANGEROUS BEING A POLLEN JOCK.<BR>
YEAH.<BR> ONCE A BEAR PINNED ME AGAINST A MUSHROOM!<BR>
HE HAD A PAW ON MY THROAT, AND WITH THE OTHER, HE WAS SLAPPING ME!<BR>
- OH, MY!<BR>

WHAT WERE YOU DOING DURING THIS?<BR>
TRYING TO ALERT THE AUTHORITIES.<BR>
I CAN AUTOGRAPH THAT.<BR>

A PUDDLE JUMP FOR US,
BUT MAYBE YOU'RE NOT UP FOR IT.<BR>
- MAYBE I AM.<BR>
- YOU ARE NOT!<BR>
WE'RE GOING 0900 AT J-GATE.<BR>
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BUZZY-BOY?<BR>
ARE YOU BEE ENOUGH?<BR>
I MIGHT BE.<BR> IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT 0900 MEANS.<BR>
HEY, HONEX!<BR>
DAD, YOU SURPRISED ME.<BR>
YOU DECIDE WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN?<BR>
- WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF CHOICES.<BR>
- BUT YOU ONLY GET ONE.<BR>
DO YOU EVER GET BORED DOING THE SAME JOB EVERY DAY?<BR>
SON, LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT STIRRING.<BR>
